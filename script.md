- Explain the command to install these packages using `pip`.

## Section 2: Verification

### Verifying GDAL Installation
- Explain the importance of verifying the GDAL installation.
- Discuss the code block that imports GDAL and prints its version.

## Section 3: Download the Data

### Placeholder for Data Download
- Mention that this section is a placeholder for downloading the necessary datasets.
- Explain where participants can find the datasets and how to download them.

## Section 4: Check out the Data in QGIS

### Placeholder for QGIS
- Discuss the importance of visualizing data in QGIS.
- Explain that this section is a placeholder for instructions on how to open and inspect the data in QGIS.

## Section 5: OGR for Vector Data

### Inspecting Vector Data
- Explain the use of `ogrinfo` to inspect vector data.
- Discuss the commands provided to inspect shapefiles and their attributes.

## Section 6: GDAL for Raster Data

### Inspecting Raster Data
- Explain the use of `gdalinfo` to inspect raster data.
- Discuss the commands provided to inspect raster files and their metadata.

## Section 7: Converting Data

### Exporting Original Data into New Formats
- Discuss the importance of data conversion in GIS.
- Explain the commands to list available formats and convert shapefiles to GeoJSON and GeoTIFF to PNG.

## Section 8: Reprojecting Data

### Reprojecting Vector and Raster Data
- Explain the concept of coordinate reference systems (CRS) and the need for reprojection.
- Discuss the commands to reproject shapefiles and raster files to a different CRS.

## Section 9: Querying Data

### Querying Data Using SQL with GDAL
- Explain the use of SQL queries to extract specific data from vector files.
- Discuss the commands to count features, select specific features, and save query results to new files.

## Section 10: Clipping to Create New Data

### Clipping Data Using GDAL
- Explain the concept of clipping data to create new datasets.
- Discuss the commands to clip vector and raster data using a GeoJSON file.

## Section 11: Previewing Data

### Using Folium to Preview Data
- Explain the use of Folium for interactive map visualization.
- Discuss the code block that loads a GeoJSON file and creates an interactive map centered around the data.

## Conclusion

### Recap and Q&A
- Recap the key points covered in the workshop.
- Open the floor for any questions from the participants.
