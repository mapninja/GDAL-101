# GDAL 101
The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library for beginners

## GDAL 101 Workshop

Welcome to the GDAL 101 Workshop repository! This workshop is designed to introduce you to the basics of using the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) for handling and processing geospatial data. Below, you'll find links to the workshop content, including the Python notebook, dataset download, and a general overview of the workshop.

## Workshop Content

### 1. Introduction to GDAL
- Overview of GDAL and its capabilities.
- Installation and setup instructions.

### 2. Working with Vector Data
- Introduction to vector data formats (e.g., Shapefile, GeoJSON).
- Inspecting and converting vector data using GDAL.

### 3. Working with Raster Data
- Introduction to raster data formats (e.g., GeoTIFF).
- Inspecting and processing raster data using GDAL.

### 4. Data Conversion
- Converting between different geospatial data formats.
- Practical examples of data conversion using GDAL.

### 5. Reprojecting Data
- Understanding coordinate reference systems (CRS).
- Reprojecting vector and raster data to different CRS.

### 6. Querying and Clipping Data
- Using SQL queries to extract specific data.
- Clipping data to create new datasets.

### 7. Visualizing Data
- Creating hillshades and color reliefs.
- Using leafmap for interactive map visualization.
